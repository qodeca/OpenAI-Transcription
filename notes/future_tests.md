# Proposals for Additional Tests for the Transcription Application

## Edge Case Tests

### 1. Audio/Video Tests
- **Test with empty audio/video file**: Check how the application behaves with empty or corrupted files
- **Test with video file without audio track**: Check how the application handles video files without sound
- **Test with very large audio/video file**: Analysis of performance and behavior with files larger than 1GB
- **Test with very short files**: Check how the application handles files lasting 1-2 seconds
- **Test with files of different sampling rates**: Check compatibility with sampling rates of 8kHz, 16kHz, 44.1kHz, 48kHz
- **Test with stereo and mono files**: Check support for different audio channel configurations

### 2. File and Path Tests
- **Test with file containing special characters in name**: Check handling of characters such as spaces, diacritical marks, emoji
- **Test with very long file paths**: Check path length limits
- **Test with read-only files**: Verify behavior when output file cannot be saved due to permissions

### 3. API and Connection Tests
- **Test with limited access to OpenAI API**: Simulation of connection problems or API limits
- **Test with different API models**: Check compatibility with different models available in the OpenAI API
- **Test with unstable internet connection simulation**: Check behavior during connection interruptions
- **Test exceeding response time limit**: Check timeout handling

### 4. Parallelism and Performance Tests
- **Test of parallel processing of multiple files**: Check behavior when running multiple instances simultaneously
- **Load test with a series of files**: Sequential processing of multiple files in one session
- **Test with limited system resources**: Application behavior with limited RAM or CPU

### 5. Functionality Tests
- **Test with different languages in source materials**: Check transcription quality for languages other than English
- **Test with material containing multiple voices/speakers**: Check transcription accuracy with multiple speakers
- **Test with poor sound quality materials**: Transcription of recordings with noise, reverb, or low quality
- **Test with material containing specialized vocabulary**: Check transcription accuracy of technical terminology

## Automated Testing Proposals
- Creation of unit tests for key application functions
- Implementation of integration tests checking the cooperation of modules
- Preparation of regression tests to ensure that fixed bugs do not reappear
- Development of performance tests measuring processing time for different file types

## Monitoring and Reporting Methods
- Implementation of detailed logging for easier problem analysis
- Addition of error and exception reporting mechanism
- Creation of performance metrics to measure processing time of different stages
